The scope of this project is to create a power plant
The power plant will have monitors display the following:
- the total amount of power that is being stored
- the amount of power that is being used
- the amount of power that is being generated.

This power plant will become the centerpiece of all industrial operations and machinery, which will become vital to the inventory management terminal.

Later on when it is expanded, there can be a power system where players can rent out power and they are charged for how much power is used.
