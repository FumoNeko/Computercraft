The scope of this project is to create a network of resonant resource caches.
A computer, or network of computers, will count all of the total resources and display this as a table {QTY, ITEM} on a monitor.
There will be a search function in order to filter desired results.
In addition, there will be an INPUT and an OUTPUT chest.
As expected, the input chest will be used to place items into the network, and the output chest will be used to take items out.
Since resonant caches can only store x10,000 items, the construction will need a scalable design.
There will need to be massive machine infrastructure from each mod to support crafting each item.
Most of the work is in the actual building and creation of the network itself.

the system will need to be able to sort items physically as well as in the form of information.
There must also exist crafting turtles to craft some of the objects.
The design must be modular to benefit the community. It should be able to define machines and identify which crafting recipes are necessary.
The system should be able to take a bank of items and identify what is craftable/smeltable/transformative.
