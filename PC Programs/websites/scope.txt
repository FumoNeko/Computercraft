The scope of this project is to have displayable websites. The websites will be user-generated content.
The main purpose of this is to create an auction house where people can post small trades and players can search for the cheapest deals.
The project will require a database of some kind and a search/filter function.
It will also need to either be able to be manually edited or have some kind of automatic system that uses Forms in order to place the trades on the website.
