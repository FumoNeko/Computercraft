This program is not my own
The program goes into wireless chat sessions and then allows the user to manipulate chat
you can write messages using someone elses username
you can also kill the server or kill certain users connections.

example:
find server
find user 1 -- <- Server ID
interact user 1 1 -- Open console to write using this user
-- Use a "?" prefix to write private messages to this user
-- Use a ":" prefix to write public messages from this user
-- Messages without prefix are public by default
-- Use "!exit" to exit the interact view
kill user 1 1 -- This will kill the users connection to server
kill server 1 -- This will kill the server and all connections
-- User a "$" prefix to access the normal shell console
