The scope of this project is to create a simple mob grinder turtle.
The mob grinder will be the classic mob grinder, with the height adjusted for the health values from DangerRPG
an attack turtle will sit at the bottom and kill the mob? (research must be done on this topic for mob xp and loot drops.)
