The scope of this project is to create a quarry system with a network of turtles.
There are 2 chests. a Fuel chest, and an output chest.
First, a large hole is created in the ground, then the turtles dig out material until they get full.
When they are full, they return and place items in the output chest, then return to mining until a specific amount of cycles are done.
When they are done, return to home position.
Calculate fuel required.
If not enough fuel, abort operation.
If out of fuel while mining, refuel.
The system should be able to adapt to situations where it must either dig or mine.
Perhaps these turtles should not be wireless but be equipped with a shovel and a pick?
