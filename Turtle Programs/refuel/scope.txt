This scope of this project is to create a snippet of code that will tell a turtle to refuel.
Most instances of a refuel involve taking the fuel out of a chest and then using the refuel
the turtle must also be able to navigate to the refuel chest.
The turtle must calculate the distance it must move in it's program as well as the distance it would take to go back to refuel.
The turtle must abort an operation before it begins if it does not have enough fuel.
A program must be able to call this program as a function
