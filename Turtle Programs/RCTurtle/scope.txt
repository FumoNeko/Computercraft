The scope of this project is to create a remote-controlled turtle with a visual peripheral.
The turtle will run live commands run by a user instead of running a script.
The keys "WASD", "SPACEBAR", and "SHIFT" will be macro'd to FORWARD, LEFT, BACK, RIGHT, UP, and DOWN.
The use case scenario of the turtle is allowing for remote exploration or other purposes i.e. pranks, griefing, etc.
